# Object Detection

This repository contains Python code for object detection and contour formation using OpenCV and the SAM Model. In case the Jupyter notebook file doesn't work here, here is the link to the Colab:

## Note

For the SAM model, make sure to have access to a GPU. You can check GPU availability using the `!nvidia-smi` command. If not available, navigate to Edit -> Notebook settings -> Hardware accelerator, set it to GPU, and then click Save. Or simply change the runtime type to GPU.

Download the `test` and `template` folders from `images.zip`. Ensure that the images are properly organized into the `template` and `test` folders and uploaded to Google Colab for access during execution.
